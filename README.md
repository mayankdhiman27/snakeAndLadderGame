Game of Snake And Ladder

This game is for 3 players (hard coded input for better understanding).

Rule:
-> Every rule is same as normal Snake and Ladder Game.
-> If any player gets 3 continuous 6s, then he/she will loose that chance.
-> Player who reaches the 100th box first will be the winner. 
-> Only 1 winner will be there, and the game will end once any player wins the game.



# Will be improved further for:
  -> random snakes and ladder position.
  -> More than 1 dice to roll at a time.
